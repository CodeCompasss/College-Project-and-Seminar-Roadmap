## 🤔 Who Is This For?

You're here because one of these is true:
- You just got assigned a "Mini Project" and have no idea where to start.
- Your final year project synopsis got rejected... again.
- You're staring at a blank Word document titled `Final_Report_v1_FINAL_v2.docx`.
- You're about to face your Viva and you're Googling "how to survive project viva."

**We've all been there.** This roadmap was born from late nights, panicked submissions, and lessons learned the hard way. It's everything we wish someone had told us.

## 💡 What's Inside?

This isn't another boring syllabus. It's a survival guide.

| Section | What You'll Learn |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[🛠️ Mini Project](./docs/mini-project/)** | How to pick a topic that isn't a "Library Management System," build it without crying, and write a report that doesn't get rejected. |
| **[🚀 Main Project](./docs/main-project/)** | Surviving Phase 1 & 2, writing a 100-page thesis without losing your mind, and facing the External Viva like a pro. |
| **[🎤 Seminar](./docs/seminar/)** | Choosing topics that impress, understanding "inner workings," and giving a presentation that doesn't put people to sleep. |
| **[🍱 Team & Soft Skills](./docs/resources/team-dynamics.md)** | How to build a dream team (and avoid "The Ghost Teammate"). |
| **[💡 Resources](./docs/resources/)** | Project ideas, scoring hacks, templates, and anonymous confessions from students who survived. |

## 🔥 A Few Hard Truths

Before you dive in, here's some unsolicited advice:

> *"Your project guide has seen a hundred students before you. They've seen every mistake, every excuse. They won't change you. But if you don't show up, you will definitely lose marks."*

> *"Don't pick a team based on who your friends are. Pick based on who actually works. You might carry them today, but the examiner will ask individual questions in the Viva."*

> *"If your presentation has a mistake and the teacher points it out, fix it that evening and show them the next morning. That's how you earn extra points."*

## ✍️ From the Authors

We're not professors. We're not "experts." We're just a bunch of students (and recent grads) who went through the chaos of CSE projects and lived to tell the tale.

This guide is our way of paying it forward. If it helps even one student avoid a last-minute panic attack, it was worth it.

*If this helped you, consider giving it a ⭐ — it helps others find it!*
