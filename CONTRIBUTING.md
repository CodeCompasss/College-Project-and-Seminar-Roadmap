# Contributing to CSE Project Roadmap 🙌

First off, **thank you** for considering contributing! This guide was built by students, for students. Your experiences, tips, templates, and even your horror stories can help someone else survive their project journey.

## 🐛 Found a Bug or Typo?

Small fixes are always welcome!
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Make your changes.
3.  Open a Pull Request with a clear description of the fix.

## 📝 Want to Add Content?

We're always looking for:

| What | How to Contribute |
| :--- | :--- |
| **New Tips or Hacks** | Add to an existing page or create a new section. |
| **Project Ideas** | Add to `docs/resources/project-ideas.md`. |
| **Templates (SRS, Reports, PPT)** | Add links to `docs/resources/templates.md`. |
| **Student Confessions** | Open an issue with the `confession` label or add to `docs/resources/confessions.md` (anonymous is fine!). |
| **Seminar Topic Ideas** | Add to `docs/seminar/topic-selection.md`. |

### Guidelines:
-   **Use a conversational tone.** We're talking *to* students, not *at* them.
-   **Include real examples.** "Don't do X" is weaker than "I once saw a team do X, and this happened..."
-   **Keep it practical.** Advice should be actionable, not generic.
