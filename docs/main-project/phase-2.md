# 🛠️ Phase 2: Execution & Implementation

Phase 2 is the most intense part of your final year. This is where you actually build the system you designed in Phase 1.

## 🏃 Agile Workflow
Don't try to build everything at once. Use a **Sprint-based approach**:
1.  **Backend & DB**: Set up the server and schemas.
2.  **API Integration**: Connect the pieces.
3.  **Frontend**: Build the user interface.
4.  **Integration**: Ensure the whole flow works.
5.  **Polishing**: Add error handling, loading states, and animations.

## 📦 Best Practices for Main Project
*   **Modular Code**: Write clean, reusable functions. Avoid "spaghetti code."
*   **Version Control**: Use Git branches (`feature/login`, `feature/payment`) correctly.
*   **Documentation in Code**: Comment your complex logic. Evaluators might read your code!
*   **Testing**: Implement Unit tests and perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

## 🔬 Research & Innovation
To secure the highest marks (the 'O' or 'S' grade), you need to add an "Innovative Element":
*   **Optimization**: Can you make an existing algorithm 10% faster?
*   **New Dataset**: Did you collect your own data for an ML project?
*   **Novel Combination**: Did you combine two existing technologies in a new way (e.g., IoT + Blockchain)?

## 📈 Monitoring Progress
*   Meet your guide at least once every 15 days.
*   Maintain a **Log Book/Dairy** signed by your guide. This is often an ignored but mandatory requirement for marks.
*   Record brief videos of your progress milestones.

!!! warning "The '90% Done' Trap"
    Most students get 90% of their project done easily but get stuck on the last 10% (CSS fixes, final bug, deployment). Budget double the time for the final 10%!
