# 🚀 Main Project Overview

> *Phase 1 is where most projects silently die. Not with a bang, but with a rejected synopsis and an unanswered email to the guide.*

The Main Project (a.k.a. Final Year Project, Major Project, Capstone) is the single biggest academic hurdle of your B.Tech. It spans two semesters, eats into your sleep, and determines a significant chunk of your final CGPA.

But here's the good news: if you do it right, it's also the most impressive thing you can put on your resume.

## 🎯 The Goal (Beyond Just Passing)

Let's get real. The official goal is to "demonstrate engineering proficiency." But what does that *actually* mean?

It means your project should be more than a "working app." It should be:
-   **A solution to a real problem** (even if it's a small problem).
-   **Well-documented** (because nobody trusts code without documentation).
-   **Defensible in a Viva** (you should be able to explain *every* design decision).

## 📅 The Two-Phase Structure

Your final year is split into two brutal semesters:

### Phase 1: Planning & Design (7th Semester)
**The Danger Zone.** This is where bad topic choices and lazy literature surveys catch up to you.
-   **Focus**: Research, Problem Definition, Feasibility Analysis.
-   **Deliverables**: Literature Survey, Synopsis, SRS, and System Design.
-   **How You're Judged**: Synopsis Presentation and Phase 1 Viva.

!!! danger "The Silent Killer"
    Phase 1 seems "easy" because there's no coding. Most students coast through it. Then Phase 2 arrives and they realize their foundation is rotten.

### Phase 2: Execution & Submission (8th Semester)
**The Grind.** Late nights, bugs, and the existential dread of a looming deadline.
-   **Focus**: Coding, Testing, Deployment, and Final Evaluation.
-   **Deliverables**: Working System, Final Report (Thesis), Research Paper (optional but recommended).
-   **How You're Judged**: Live Demo, External Viva, Final Defense.

## 🔑 The 4 Things Evaluators Actually Care About

Forget what the syllabus says. Here's what matters:

1.  **Problem Complexity**: Is the problem worth solving? Or is it just CRUD with extra steps?
2.  **Technical Implementation**: Is the code well-structured? Or is it spaghetti?
3.  **Documentation Quality**: Is the report professional? Or is it a wall of text with random screenshots?
4.  **Team Coordination**: Does the whole team know the project, or did one person carry everyone?

## 💀 The "90% Done" Trap

A warning for Phase 2:

> *Most students get 90% of their project done relatively easily. It's the last 10% that takes 90% of the time.*

That last 10% includes:
- Fixing the one bug that crashes the demo.
- Formatting the 120-page report.
- Deploying to a live server (not `localhost`).
- Preparing for the 50 questions the external examiner might ask.

**Budget double the time for the final 10%.**
