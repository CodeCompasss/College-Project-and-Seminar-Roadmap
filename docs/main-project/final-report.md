## 🎨 Professional Formatting Tips
*   **LaTeX**: Highly recommended for a professional look. Use platforms like **Overleaf**.
*   **Hyperlinks**: Ensure the Table of Contents is clickable.
*   **Image Quality**: Don't use blurry screenshots. Use high-resolution exports.
*   **Captions**: Every figure and table *must* have a number and a caption (e.g., "Figure 4.2: System Architecture").

## 🛑 Plagiarism Check
Most colleges allow a maximum of **10% to 20%** plagiarism.
*   Use tools like **Quillbot** to paraphrase (but don't rely only on it).
*   Correctly cite every source you use.
*   Write the Abstract and Conclusion from scratch.

!!! tip "Page Count Hack"
    Don't fill pages with useless code. Instead, expand your **System Design** section with more detailed diagrams and explain each diagram in 2-3 paragraphs.
