# 🏆 Scoring High: Secrets Toppers Won't Share

> *Getting 95%+ in your project isn't about being the best coder. It's about understanding "Evaluator Psychology."*

Let's be real. The student with the most innovative project doesn't always get the highest marks. The student who **presents** it best, **documents** it professionally, and **handles** the Viva confidently... they do.

Here's what actually works.

## 1. 📄 Documentation: The First Impression (25% of marks)

Examiners often **flip through your report first**, before they even see your code.

### The Cheat Codes:
-   **Professional Diagrams**: Use Draw.io or Figma. Hand-drawn diagrams in 2026 are a crime.
-   **Consistent Fonts**: Times New Roman or Arial, 1.5 spacing. No mixing fonts.
-   **20+ References**: Having a long IEEE-formatted bibliography makes your work look like serious research.
-   **Figure Captions**: Every diagram must have a caption: "Figure 4.2: System Architecture Diagram."

!!! tip "The 'Before You Print' Checklist"
    - [ ] Table of Contents is hyperlinked.
    - [ ] Page numbers are correct.
    - [ ] All figures and tables have captions.
    - [ ] No placeholder text like "[Insert diagram here]."

## 2. 🚀 The Demo: The "Wow" Factor (40% of marks)

This is where marks are won or lost.

### What Impresses Evaluators:
-   **Speed**: If your page takes 10 seconds to load, you've lost them. Use caching.
-   **Dashboards > Tables**: Instead of showing raw data in a table, show a **beautiful chart**. Use Recharts, Chart.js, or D3.
-   **Error Handling**: Enter an invalid input. If a nice toast notification appears instead of a raw `500 Internal Server Error`, you look like a pro.
-   **Live URL**: `myproject.vercel.app` beats `localhost:3000`. Always.

### What to Avoid:
-   **Hardcoded Data**: If the demo only works with one specific user, you're in trouble.
-   **Unrealistic Dependencies**: Don't build a project that needs access to a Government API you don't have. Many students discover mid-demo that an integration is "impossible."

## 3. 🤝 The Guide Relationship (20% of marks)

Your guide controls your internal marks. Treat this relationship like a professional one.

### How to Win:
-   **Weekly Updates**: Even if you made no progress, send an email: "Status: Debugging API integration, will update by Friday."
-   **Keep Receipts**: Every email is a timestamp proving you were working. This is your "Paper Trail."
-   **Act on Feedback Immediately**: If your guide points out an issue in a review, **fix it by the next morning** and show them. This demonstrates initiative and earns bonus points.

!!! warning "The Exhausted Guide"
    Your guide has seen hundreds of students. They've heard every excuse. They're tired. Don't try to change them. Just show up, do the work, and meet deadlines. They'll reward consistency.

## 4. 🎤 The Viva: Confidence Beats Perfection (15% of marks)

The examiner is not trying to fail you. They just want to see that **you** understand **your** project.

### Tips:
-   **Know Your Code**: If you can't explain a function, don't put it in your project.
-   **Everyone Knows Everything**: In a team, Member A should be able to explain Member B's module. Examiners test this.
-   **Admit Limitations**: "The current system doesn't handle real-time updates; that's a future scope item" is better than lying.

## 🔥 The Final "Pro" Checklist

Before the final submission, ask yourself:

- [ ] Does the demo work without internet (or with a backup)?
- [ ] Is there a working search and filter functionality?
- [ ] Is the source code clean and commented?
- [ ] Does the GitHub README look professional?
- [ ] Do I have a 1-minute video demo recorded as backup?

    *"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."*

    Apply this to every line of your code, every slide in your PPT, and every answer in your Viva.
