*Real stories. Real mistakes. Real lessons.*

## 💀 The Disasters

!!! failure "The Localhost Legend"
    > *"I submitted my final project build with `http://localhost:5000` hardcoded in the API calls. It worked perfectly on my laptop. It worked on zero other machines. The external examiner stared at a loading spinner for 45 seconds."*

!!! failure "The Git Disaster"
    > *"I learned Git on the day of submission. I ran `git push --force` and erased my teammate's two weeks of work. We submitted a half-finished project."*

!!! failure "The Password Paradox"
    > *"During the demo, I confidently typed the admin password. 'Incorrect.' Tried again. 'Incorrect.' Account locked. I had changed the password the night before and forgot. The demo ended there."*

!!! failure "The Ghost Returns"
    > *"My teammate disappeared for 3 weeks. On the day of the Viva, he showed up in a suit and answered questions about the 'backend architecture' — the same backend he never touched. He got a B. I still think about it."*

## 😅 The Close Calls

!!! warning "The 4 AM Miracle"
    > *"Our project had a critical bug that crashed the app every 5 minutes. At 4 AM on submission day, I found a StackOverflow answer from 2014. It worked. I don't know why. I never changed that code."*

!!! warning "The Fake Demo"
    > *"Our search feature was broken. So, I hardcoded the search results for the three queries I knew the examiner would type. He typed all three. Praised the 'fast search algorithm.' We passed."*
    
    **Editor's Note: We do NOT recommend this. But it's real.**

!!! warning "The Voice Note Viva"
    > *"The night before the Viva, my teammate sent me a 15-minute voice note explaining 'his' module because he wasn't confident. I memorized it. In the Viva, I was asked about that module. I regurgitated the voice note. We both passed."*

## 💡 The Lessons Learned

!!! success "The Paper Trail Saved Me"
    > *"I sent my guide an update email every single week for 6 months. At the end, when my teammate tried to claim he did more work than me, I forwarded all 24 emails to the HOD. Case closed."*

!!! success "The 'I Fixed It' Power Move"
    > *"During my Phase 1 review, my guide ripped my synopsis apart. I went home, fixed everything, and showed up at his cabin at 9 AM the next day with the corrected version. He smiled and said, 'This is how engineers work.' I got extra marks."*

!!! success "The Backup Video Saved My Life"
    > *"My app crashed during the live demo. The examiner looked annoyed. I said, 'Sir, I have a recorded video of the full demo.' I played a 3-minute video. He nodded and said, 'Good preparation.' I passed."*
