# 📄 Final Submission & Documentation

The final marks are often decided by your **Report** and your **Viva**. A great project with a bad report will score less than an average project with a perfect report.

## 📁 The Mini Project Report Structure
A standard report (20-40 pages) usually follows this order:

1.  **Title Page**: Project name, team members, guide name.
2.  **Abstract**: A one-page summary of the problem and solution.
3.  **Introduction**: Background and motivation.
4.  **Requirement Analysis**: SRS (Functional/Non-functional requirements).
5.  **Design**:
    *   System Architecture.
    *   Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram.
    *   Data Flow Diagram (DFD).
6.  **Implementation**: Screenshots and explanation of key modules.
7.  **Testing**: Test cases and results.
8.  **Conclusion & Future Scope**: What's next?
9.  **References**: Links to sources.

## 🎤 Cracking the Internal Viva
Your evaluators will ask questions to check if **you** actually built the project.

### Common Questions:
1.  "Why did you choose this specific tech stack (e.g., Why MongoDB instead of MySQL)?"
2.  "Show me the part of the code where the database connection is established."
3.  "What happens if I enter an invalid input here?" (Live testing)
4.  "If you had another month, what features would you add?"

### Tips for Success:
*   **Know your code**: Don't ever copy code you don't understand. If you used a library, know what it does.
*   **Be Honest**: If you couldn't implement a feature, explain *why* (e.g., technical limitations) instead of lying.
*   **Live Demo**: Ensure your project is "warm" (servers running, DB connected) before the judges arrival.

!!! tip "Plagiarism Warning"
    Colleges use tools like **Turnitin** or **Moodle** to check reports. Don't copy-paste abstracts or conclusions from the internet. Write them in your own words!
